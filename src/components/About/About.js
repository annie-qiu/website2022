            I&apos;m Annie, a â€˜24 at Dartmouth College studying Computer Science with a minor in Studio Art.
            As a visual artist, designer, and computer science student, my passions lie in the intersection of design and technology.
            From painting to coding scripts and designing mobile applications, I love to use problem solving and visual analysis to create delightful, impactful, and humane creations.

            I&apos;m from Shanghai, China (my favorite place in the world) but have also lived in upstate NY, Singapore, and Hanover, NH.
