    text: '**Well Buddies was created for students to prioritize their own wellbeing despite busy schedules.** The app gives users a digital pet and integrates with your Google Calendar to schedule in wellness activities that fit with your schedule. When you complete a wellness activity, your buddy’s mood improves so that when you take care of your buddy, you also take care of yourself. \n \nWell Buddies was first created for HackDartmouth VII as a small web app built with React and won 2nd place in the Health and Recovery track. We then turned the website into a full-stack mobile app with Google Calendar integration with React-Native. \n \nI worked on integrating Google authentication and used the Google Calendar API to get the user’s calendar events and available times. On the back-end, I worked on providing the app with suggested wellness activities based on the user’s availabilities. I also created the designs and illustrations in Figma.',

The SVPP staff and Dartmouth IT worked with DALI Lab to design and deploy a full-stack web application for students to manage their progress with the curriculum and for administrators to maintain the curriculum. Our partners requested that the solution should be intuitive and motivate students to be more engaged in the curriculum.\n \n I worked as a UI/UX designer as well as a developer on the project. As a designer, I used UX Research methods, sketched solutions, created grayscales and hifi prototypes, and ideated a comprehensive design system to produce a MVP for the SVPP platform. As a developer, I worked on adding authentication for administrators, different permission levels for administrators, and implemented features such as allowing admins to assign curriculums to students and assign requirements to students. \n \n The project is currently being finished up by Dartmouth ITC and will soon be deployed for all future Dartmouth students with an incoming freshman class of 1,400+.\n\n Our design process was driven by the question: *How might we create a seamless integration of SVPP education into students’ lives by eliminating elements of confusion, demotivation, and cognitive overload?*',
