    text: '**Well Buddies was created for students to prioritize their own wellbeing despite busy schedules.** The app gives users a digital pet and integrates with your Google Calendar to schedule in wellness activities that fit with your schedule. When you complete a wellness activity, your buddy’s mood improves so that when you take care of your buddy, you also take care of yourself. \n \nWell Buddies was first created for HackDartmouth VII as a small web app built with React and won 2nd place in the Health and Recovery track. We then turned the website into a full-stack mobile app with Google Calendar integration with React-Native. \n \nI worked on integrating Google authentication and used the Google Calendar API to get the user’s calendar events and available times. On the back-end, I worked on providing the app with suggested wellness activities based on the user’s availabilities. I also created the designs and illustrations in Figma.',
